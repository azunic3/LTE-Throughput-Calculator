#  LTE Throughput Calculator

 A simple **LTE Throughput Calculator** built with **React (Vite) and Node.js (Express)**.  
It calculates LTE downlink throughput based on bandwidth, frequency, cyclic prefix,  
and distance using the Free Space Path Loss model and LTE SINR-to-MCS mapping.

##  Features
-  **Frontend:** React + Vite + Axios  
-  **Backend:** Node.js + Express  
-  **Uses real LTE formulas for accurate calculations**  
-  **Handles input validation and error messages**  
-  **Responsive UI with a clean, modern design**

##  Formulas Used

###  **Free Space Path Loss (FSPL)**
Loss(dB) = 20log(d) + 20log(f) + 32.45

where:
- `d` = distance (km)
- `f` = frequency (MHz)

###  Received Power Calculation
P_r = P_t - Loss

where:
- `P_r` = Received power (dBm)
- `P_t` = Transmission power (43 dBm)

###  SINR Calculation
SINR = P_r - P_n

where:
- `P_n` = Noise + Interference (-110 dBm)

###  LTE Throughput Calculation
T = BW × Efficiency factor

where:
- `BW` = Bandwidth (MHz)
-  Efficiency factor is mapped based on **SINR values**
